# Wireframing

## Introduction to Wireframing
Wireframing is a basic, schematic representation of a user interface that shows the arrangement of essential elements like buttons, menus, images, and text without detailed design features.  
It is a crucial step in the design process because it helps organize ideas, plan user experience, and reduce errors before starting detailed design or development.

## Key Elements of a Wireframe
- **Layout Structure:** The organization and arrangement of page elements such as the header, menus, main content, and footer.  
- **Navigation:** Elements that help users move between pages or sections, such as menus, buttons, and links.  
- **Content Placement:** The positioning of text, images, videos, and other content components.  
- **Functionality:** How elements behave, such as submit buttons, registration forms, etc.

## Types of Wireframes
- **Low-fidelity wireframes:** Simple designs showing the general layout without colors or details, usually used at the beginning of the design process.  
- **High-fidelity wireframes:** Detailed designs that closely resemble the final product, including colors, text, and precise details, used in later design stages.

## Wireframing Tools
Popular tools include Figma, Adobe XD, Sketch, and Balsamiq.  
**Figma** is a collaborative online design tool that allows teams to create wireframes and interactive prototypes easily, supporting real-time collaboration.

## Benefits of Wireframing in Software Development
- Clarifies ideas for developers and designers  
- Reduces misunderstandings within the team  
- Identifies design issues early in the process  
- Saves time and effort by minimizing rework

## Wireframing in Practice
In a project designing an online ordering app, the team discovered during wireframing that the "Add to Cart" button was not clearly visible to users.  
By adjusting the buttonâ€™s placement in the wireframe, user experience improved significantly.  
This allowed the team to update the design before development, saving time and effort and ensuring a user-friendly final product.
